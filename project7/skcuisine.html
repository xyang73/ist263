    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="i1">Guizhou Province, in southwest China, has beautiful landscape, colorful minority customs and mouth-watering food; distinctively spicy and sour food. <br>If you like spicy or other strong-flavored food, Guizhou will be a culinary paradise for you.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="i2">One reason is that the Guizhou climate is humid with lots of rainfall, and the gloomy and cold weather can easily lead to illness. People eat spicy food to dispel the cold and wet. Another reason is that salt was a scarce commodity in ancient Guizhou. <br>Even as recently as decades ago, salt could not be produced in Guizhou and it was difficult to transport it in, but the mountainous environment was always suitable for growing chili pepper. For these two reasons, Guizhou people in past times used chili as seasoning, and the habit became a tradition.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="i3">“Eat large pieces of meat, drink large bowls of wine.” This popular saying among Guizhou minority people reflects their enthusiastic character. <br>Guizhou dishes are as “hot” as the people who live there. Now, let’s take a look at some famous dishes in Guizhou.
