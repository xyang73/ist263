My name is Iris Yang.
I major in Applied Data Analytics interested in examining data to draw the inferences related to business.
My professional skills are using Python and R to visualize data, as well as using SQL to migrate data.
Out of work, I love dancing and listening to K-pop music. My favorite TV show for now is a k-drama called “Our Beloved Summer”. 
I am excited to learn more skills about web design on IST263.
